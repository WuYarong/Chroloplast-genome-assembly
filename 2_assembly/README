## Radom reads
1. 100x illumina reads for assembly quality assessment were separte first using scripts in https://github.com/roblanf/splitreads
2. The random reads (can be set for different coverage) were generated using scripts in https://github.com/roblanf/splitreads (optional)

## long read assembly
3. Long read only assembly were using Hinge and Canu
4. Sometimes (in low coverage) Hinge failed to assemble a genome, change cut_off in nominal.ini from 300 to 10 could help
5. The fasta2DB in Hinge can recoginze pacbio read header only, change the header (if not use pacbio data) using hinge/1_convertName.sh
6. The hybrid assembly and short read only assembly was using Unicycler. The input read is corrected by SPAdes by default setting in Unicycler. It can be turned off using --no_correct
7. Assembly is polished by Pilon in Unicycler by default setting
8. Unicycler is supported by python3
